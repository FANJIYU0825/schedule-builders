        "description": "How do animals function? That is the fundamental question underlying the course. The course zooms in on particular groups of animals and examines them in detail from a functional perspective. We take a closer look at the tissues that make up their bodies, examine their physiology and sense organs, and study their muscles and skeletons (hard or hydrostatic? external or internal?) both from a general mechanical perspective and specifically in relation to the lifestyle of the particular organism.In addition to lectures and seminars the course includes practical components, notably a series of dissections. The kinds of animals will vary somewhat from year to year, but we can promise that the dissections will always be interesting and informative.The course also contains a weeks field trip to our biology station \"Klubban\" at the Swedish west coast where we collect and study marine animals."

        "description": "This course uses catchment areas as natural units in order to understand how ecosystems on land and in water are connected, and how human activities affect ecosystems. Based on knowledge of the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as of the movement of water through the landscape, you will learn how to measure and evaluate different kinds of anthropogenic disturbances. Thereby, this course gives knowledge on how ecosystem services can be used in a sustainable and balanced way.The course has a strong applied side, because it understands disturbances to ecosystems by humans through the use of catchment areas, just like water management in the EU and many other parts of the world. A case study of a catchment close to Uppsala includes both practical work in the field and lab, as well as evaluation of both anthropogenic disturbances and nature values. The course also contains education in geographic information systems (GIS) integrated into the course content. GIS is a widely used tool in natural resource management, and the course also contains an individual GIS project in close collaboration with active researchers, which gives you deepened GIS skills. Towards the end of the course, different catchments are evaluated in order to identify suitable areas for protection within the European Natura 2000 network."

It is therefore imperative to examine how social and cultural values influence scientific traditions, how scientific knowledge is produced, and the implications of what is produced through various scientific epistemologies.With the specific help of feminist and gender studies theories and approaches this course introduces you to a range of historical and contemporary debates about the production of nature and scientific knowledge and their implications. You are then encouraged to examine, problematise and apply these perspectives in relation to each other as well as to various contemporary issues."

Heritage has always been a target in armed conflicts between belligerent groups. However, it has also always been used in the reconstruction of a society to support a common history and identity. However, heritage is not an innocent agent in the reconstruction of society, but can also cause disjunction and renew conflicts in time and space. To illustrate the dynamic and dual role of heritage, case studies from conflict, reconciliation and natural hazards are presented and analysed.The course uses a multidisciplinary perspective based on ongoing international research. Upon completion of the course, you are expected to have gained a deeper analytical understanding of the processes behind the targeting of heritage in conflict, and the mechanism of rebuilding and reconciliation relevant to policy and evaluation."

However, all these behaviours are linked to a series of disparate and yet deeply-interconnected cultural 'worlds': from those of the Sámi in the north, to the Christian kingdoms of mainland Europe and the British Isles, to the more sparsely populated North Atlantic, to the Slavic populations of the southern and eastern Baltic, the Steppe peoples, the Byzantine Empire and Mediterranean world, and the Caliphate. People from all these regions were also moving into Scandinavia, bringing with them their own cultural influences. Furthermore, Scandinavia acted within even wider connections tied into the arterial trade routes of the Silk Roads, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and in the later part of the Viking Age, with direct access to resources from Greenland and North America. These zones of interaction each exerted their own influences on each other, as well as on the societies of Scandinavia itself. This course is designed to situate the Viking diaspora within its wider, global context, while also exploring interconnectivity across and between regions."

The discipline has a technical focus and is based on an integration of skills and methods from biology, chemistry, materials science and physics. There are many established application areas for nanobiotechnology, particularly in diagnostics and healthcare. Development is however very fast and nanotechnology is therefore now spreading to new areas. The course focuses on basic principles and how nanobiotechnology can be used in practice.Biosensors are examples of analytical instruments exploiting new nanobiotechnological principles and therefore constitute a large part of the course. They are, for example, used for detecting chemical substances that occur in our environment or food. The use of biosensors for life science research has become important for the study of biological systems and drug discovery.Lab practicals and demonstrations, and a theoretical project are included in the course. Design of new nanobiotechnological products based on current knowledge and possibilities is included as an important element in the course."

        "description": "This course approaches anthropological theory from three different perspectives: historically, thematically, and through contemporary anthropological research.The first perspective explores some of the key problems to which modern social and cultural anthropology has emerged as a response. The second focuses on major theories, themes, and debates that have informed anthropological inquiry. The third exemplifies how anthropologists revisit and remediate classical theoretical discussions in analytical work today.In addition to reading the course literature, you are expected to take an active part in seminar discussions, complete several writing exercises, and present a course paper orally in class. By the end of the course, you should have acquired the ability critically to discuss central aspects of the history of anthropological theory and be able to make use of such knowledge in the construction of contemporary anthropological problems."

The boundaries between nature and culture are increasingly being called into question. This course investigates how contemporary environmental concerns have a long history and are the result of the interplay between culture, politics, economics, technology and ecology. Understanding and managing such complex problems, therefore, requires scientific knowledge about how ecosystems work. But it also demands knowledge about how cultural notions, social norms, economic values, and political interests shape people's relations to organic and non-organic nature.The course explores fundamental issues about meaning, value and action in relations between societies and environments. It provides ethnographic perspectives on some of the environmental challenges facing human societies and ecosystems, how different people deal with them in different ways, and how the humanities and social sciences can critically engage with these challenges."

Safe, healthy and profitable deep mining is only possible if many serious challenges are overcome. For example, rock temperatures will increase, requiring improved ventilation and cooling. Changes in air pressure can affect both the eardrums of mine workers and the calibration of instruments to measure flammable gases. Rock stresses will increase to the point that the rock strength is exceeded, resulting in mining-related seismicity and rock bursting. Consequently, it is imperative that seismogenic structures are recognised in advance and those excavations are reinforced to be rockburst resistant. In this course, we will look at technical and management strategies to meet these challenges."

In the pragmatics portion of the course, we consider the ways in which meaning is context-dependent and the ways in which speakers achieve goals using language. In the sociolinguistics portion of the course, we analyse the linguistic resources with which speakers show their connection to a given community and express identity.

        "description": "For decades, the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide and the terror in the Soviet Union have represented the suffering that has affected millions of innocent civilians throughout history, sometimes with the aim of eliminating groups of people in whole or in part. The fact that the worst cases of genocide and other mass killings happened outside the context of an armed conflict between victim groups and perpetrators has meant that standard theoretical models from the field of conflict theory cannot explain this type of extreme behaviour.In order to provide in-depth explanations and increase our knowledge of the character of extreme forms of violence, we, therefore, need to place specific events in their proper historical, cultural, social, political, ideological and other contexts. After the course, you will have increased knowledge of some of the most important cases of genocide and mass killing up until the mid-twentieth century, with a particular focus on the nineteenth-century colonisation processes, the growth of nationalist, fascist and communist ideologies during the first half of the twentieth century, and the two world wars. You will obtain knowledge about some key theoretical concepts while acquiring important skills in the comparative method."

        "description": "The genocide in Rwanda and the \"ethnic cleansing\" in former Yugoslavia at the end of the twentieth century came as a shock for many Western intellectuals. Gradually, they began to understand that these and other similar events had their roots in a failed transition from colonial and autocratic forms of government to democracy in the context of incomplete state and nation-building processes. It was also clear that the mass killings differed substantially when it came to perpetrator goals, the character of violence, the level of systematicity and death tolls, which lead to an increased interest in better understanding the political, economic, social and cultural contexts in which the violence happened.This course gives you a deepened understanding of several cases of genocide and mass killing during the latter part of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Special attention is paid to de-colonisation and its effects, as well as to the importance of globalisation and the democratisation processes that followed the fall of communism. You will thus gain deepened knowledge about several research topics of central importance to understanding the character of genocidal violence, as well as its impact on the societies affected. These include the effect of different cultural, historical, political, ideological, gender-related and other identity-related aspects, as well as recent trends in the development of democratisation, human rights, transitional justice and international intervention."

In standard European terms, this period coincided with the Early and High Middle Ages, during which processes of state formation and the development of politics, culture and economic structures were intense.Furthermore, it is now recognised that these societies were dependent on the contributions of both men and women, although the boundaries between genders are also discussed. Ethnicity is another topic of discussion.During the course, we will study primary sources from the period, in various forms, from Sagas and chronicles to rune stones and material culture, and use classic textbooks to further our understanding of the Vikings."

        "description": "During much of the 20th century, Sweden had a reputation for being one of the most advanced and egalitarian social welfare states. Based on the idea of the folkhem (the \"people's home\") social justice was enshrined as a core value of the political-economic system. This had an impact not least on urban and regional development policies, as well as the shaping of the landscape. By the 21st century, however, many of the policies upon which the folkhem was constructed have been significantly transformed or even dismantled. This course focuses on the reasons behind these changes, and their implication for the social, economic and political geography of Sweden. What are the contemporary challenges to, and possibilities for, achieving common welfare goals within a national space increasingly divided, for example, along lines of class, ethnicity, and age, as well as between the urban and the rural? How are these changes and challenges manifested in people's everyday landscapes?"

With increasing data volumes, the interest in using various other computational platforms has increased. One important example of this is the use of GPUs, originally graphics processing units, for machine learning (GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit).Sometimes, one can get adequate or even great performance for a specific task by using an existing framework that supports an accelerator, such as a GPU. However, frequently it can be beneficial to write customised accelerator code. In this course, we review various accelerator types and compare them to traditional CPUs. We also explore the CPU/accelerator interface, and how we can program and profile performance on accelerators. Profiling is of uttermost importance in an accelerator context, since it is frequently a great challenge to actually unlock the theoretical gains in efficiency promised by the accelerators."

        "description": "When a numerical method is used for solving problems in application areas, unexpected phenomena might arise. There might be non-physical oscillations in the solution or the execution time might be very high. When such things happen an analysis of the numerical method is required. The analysis has two goals, to understand for what problems and what choices of parameters the method works, and to choose the best method out of a number of possible ones for a specific problem.One half of the course focus on so-called difference methods for partial differential equations, and the other half on finite element methods. The central concepts of consistency, convergence and stability are covered in detail and the methods are compared with respect to execution time."

Through the use of models, one can study and simulate financial markets, e.g. the value of options, stocks and other security papers. To do so, computers and numerical methods are used. This course covers the numerical methods that are used within financial mathematics, specifically methods for the valuation of options, stocks and other security papers.The content covers both the use of commercial software as well as studies of the computational methods and their properties. Methods covered are i.e. Monte Carlo methods and methods based on so-called finite differences. The methods are general-purpose methods, even though they are used for financial mathematics here. Thus, what you learn in the course can be used not only in the financial area but in other areas as well.The course is examined through mini projects with oral and written presentations.The course is closely related to 1TD186 Computational Finance - Calibration and estimation, but the courses can be taken in any order."

There are many applications, e.g. in forestry and agriculture, environmental supervision, astronomy, medicine and industrial quality control. The image can come from a microscope, a computer tomograph, a TV camera, a satellite or a telescope. The size of the image can range from a few micrometres to light-years. The aim can be analysis made by the human eye or a computerised analysis.Through the use of computers and mathematical transformations, the image can be improved to make a visual interpretation easier. Data such as size, texture and number can be found in the image. The data can be processed statistically leading to an interpretation and a decision."

What are the differences and overlapping between the protection of personal data and the protection of personal privacy? How is intellectual property protected, e.g. how do you legally protect a machine learning tool? How has data science as a whole affected the development of legislation and why, namely, what interests have become important to protect because of the new possibilities to process data? How do you balance the interests of the different actors? And, how do you solve liability issues?The course introduces relevant ethical theories and provides a background in legal aspects."

In functional programming, the programmer does this by defining a (mathematical) function. Declarative programming is thus very different from imperative programming and object-oriented programming, where a program is basically a sequence of steps. Come and widen your programming-language horizon. Declarative programming is not difficult and leads often to very elegant programs, once you are used to it!The main objective is to learn functional programming and to see how well it realises the aim of declarative programming. Functional programming is successfully used in many industrial projects, which makes knowledge of it a useful asset in the job market. Improvements in programming quality and speed by several factors are not uncommon.The course covers theoretical foundations as well as practical programming exercises in Haskell. You also learn when it is wiser to use declarative programming rather than imperative programming or object-oriented programming."

Simulations on the computer screen work as a complement to, and sometimes as a replacement to experiments and theory. Computers and mathematical/statistical models are used to describe reality and to produce new products that can be more energy efficient and more friendly to the environment. Models and simulations are also used to study the future, for example, climate change, and can therefore affect political decisions. When computations take place in computers, the methods that are used are very different from the hand calculation methods you learnt in school. In scientific computing, we study these computational methods.In this course, you learn about the principles and the ideas behind these computational methods, but also how to think when you solve problems with computers and programming. Basic concepts, ideas, and methods in scientific computing are covered in the course. The main themes in the course are numeric solutions to integrals, non-linear equations and differential equations in one variable."

The course teaches the use of tools to solve hard combinatorial optimisation problems by first modelling them in a solver-independent constraint modelling language and then using an off-the-shelf constraint solver, as opposed to designing an (approximation) algorithm from first principles.The theory and algorithms underlying the constraint solvers used in this course will not be explained in depth, as specialised courses exist for this purpose, hence the course is relevant for students in many research areas, not only computer science, especially nowadays that combinatorial problems become more and more central to many research activities.

EU legislative action in the field poses significant challenges to the legal orders of the Member States and is one of the most contested fields of EU action. There are two main reasons for this: First, the development of EU criminal law has a significant impact on the protection of fundamental rights and the relationship between the individual and the state. Second, the development of EU criminal law poses challenges to state sovereignty and the relationship between the EU and its Member States.In this course, we will examine some of the main aspects of EU criminal law in light of these main challenges. We will address:\tthe evolution of EU criminal law;\tthe EU criminal law competencies and control mechanisms;\tthe legislative implementation of EU criminal law in Member States;\tthe interpretation of these measures by the Member State courts;\tthe EU law demands on domestic legal orders and on the protection of fundamental rights.The focus will be specifically set on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law and procedure; mutual recognition and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; action by EU bodies in criminal matters; and the protection of personal data and individual privacy. As a result, we will be able to draw some general conclusions about the constitutional developments of EU law in general, and EU criminal law in particular.InstructionYou prepare for the seminars both individually and in working groups. At the seminars, students present their findings and participate actively in the discussion. All students must also submit an essay that will be presented orally and discussed.ExaminationIn order to pass the course you must participate in the seminars and lectures, participate actively in the seminars, and compose, orally present and discuss an essay.

        "description": "The regulation of medicinal products, medical devices, and services is complex. The competence to regulate the field is divided between the EU and its Member States. The legal framework consists of public international law instruments, EU legislation, national law, and self-regulation. In addition, regulation in the field must comply with different fundamental rights as well as with the economic freedoms under EU Law. From a policy perspective, the research, manufacturing, and distribution of medicinal products, medical devices, and services also raise ethical and human rights issues that must be balanced against economic interests, the promotion of scientific research, and the public good.   The course EU Pharmaceutical law captures the multitude of layers of competencies and regulation with the purpose to study the relevant actors and their competencies. In addition, it purports to study the interaction between different legal frameworks and the content of the legal rules which regulate research, development, commercialisation, and use of medicinal products and medical devices, as well as the provision of services. Finally, the course focuses on the conflicts and the balancing of interests between different values which permeate policies and law-making in EU pharmaceutical law.   The course focuses specifically on the following themes:\tIdentification of the relevant actors and analysis of their competencies in the regulation of the EU Pharmaceutical Law.\tThe impact of public international law instruments and fundamental rights on law-making and application of EU and national rules in the field.\tThe regulation of research, development, and sales of medicinal products, medical devices and services under the main regulatory instruments in EU Pharmaceutical Law.\tThe impact of rules on economic rights and competition in EU Law on the specific regulation of medicinal products, medical devices, and related services in EU and national law.\tThe regulation of trade, distribution, sales, and use of medicinal products and medical devices at the national level.\tThe protection of rights and interests of individuals, particularly vulnerable groups, at both the EU and national level in the field.TeachingTeaching and learning activities will take place in the form of lectures, seminars and group work. The main part of the teaching is conducted in seminar form. All lectures and seminars are mandatory. You are expected to participate actively in seminars and group work. AssessmentTo pass the course, you must participate in all compulsory parts of the course and complete the examination. The examination for the course consists of a) a portfolio of written notes capturing the essence of the seminars according to the specifications made in the study plan (pass/fail); b) active participation in the seminars (pass/fail); c) individual essay (graded), d) active participation in a final conference according to the specifications made in the study plan (graded)."

        "description": "Within the last decade, the technological advances and societal uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) have been enormous. Currently, AI is getting a foothold in almost any aspect of life. AI software (personalised recommender systems, automated risk assessment systems, image analytics, etc.) has become ubiquitous and is increasingly embedded within smart objects such as voice assistants, smart cameras, drones and self-driving cars. AI is used to classify (\"social sorting\") as well as to create (such as \"deepfakes\"). AI is not just the object of regulation but is also increasingly used as a tool for regulation and enforcement. This course gives an introduction to some salient legal debates surrounding the uptake of AI within society.Four important themes in the course are:\tThe basics of AI. What is AI? How can society be regulated and organised by means of information technology (IT) and AI? How do AI applications affect a variety of legal domains (constitutional law, data protection, intellectual property, torts law, etc.)?\tData: the legal status of AI input and output. We discuss the legal status of what goes in and what comes out of AI models: input and output data.\tNew EU instruments and policies regulating AI. This includes the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and the Copyright Directive 2019/790, as well as legal instruments that are currently still in the making as part of the digital strategy of the EU: the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the Data Governance Act and the Data Act.\tAI in practice. We discuss several practical examples of how AI is used and the legal issues that it raises.The course deepens the understanding of the relationship between law and AI as regards both practical and theoretical legal problems. The main focus of the course is on EU law but when relevant other international and national legal instruments are discussed. InstructionThe teaching consists of seminars, lectures and student presentations. The lectures are intended to provide context and interpretation of the reading material and the main issues the course deals with. All seminars are obligatory and active participation in the seminars is a requirement to pass the course. During seminars, you are required to actively participate in discussions, answer questions, present written assignments and discuss the contributions of other students in a respectful manner. If special reasons exist, the course director may exempt a student from attending particular seminars and may require appropriate replacement tasks to be performed. You prepare for the seminars both individually and in a study group (\"basgrupp\") of 4-5 students. The required preparation for the seminars consists of the literature for the course as a whole, and any special reading instructions given for the seminar. During some of the seminars, you will be required to present a short written assignment or give a short commentary on the assignment of another student. AssessmentThe final grade is based on 4 aspects:\tClass attendance and active participation.\tWritten assignments (each 3-4 pages). You will present these assignments orally during class and receive comments from another student that has been designated as an opponent.\tCommentaries (written and oral; written commentaries of 1-2 pages) on written assignments from other students.\tA written paper (10-20 pages) on a topic relevant to the course.The final grade obtained for the course is based on a balanced assessment of the examination portfolio, where 1-3 (attendance, participation, short written assignments and commentaries presented orally during the seminar) contribute 45% to the final grade and 4 (a written paper of 10-20 pages) contributes 55%."

The course will further give an increased understanding of how the uptake of drugs in cells can be stimulated by binding to receptors on specific cells and drug delivery principles that utilise conjugation to ligands such as antibodies.We will also investigate aspects of personalised dosage forms and theranostic drug delivery systems that combine diagnosis (especially image-guided diagnosis) and therapy, as well as stimuli-responsive systems. This includes drug delivery systems for macromolecules, e.g. proteins and peptides, vaccines, genes and oligonucleotides, and their intracellular release.Finally, the course will cover novel formulation technologies (e.g. microfluidics), additive manufacturing (3D printing of dosage forms) and continuous manufacturing."

        "description": "The term nanoscience refers to exploration of changes in physical properties originating from changes in the extension of materials. The emphasis of the content is therefore on effects arising from finite size effects in the electronic structure of materials, manifested in for example changes in magnetic properties, electric conductivity and generally coupling of electronic states to applied electromagnetic fields. The reading material is based upon the scientific literature, providing training in searching and extracting relevant information.The course will provide understanding of finite size scaling, dimensionality aspects of phase transitions, giant magnetic resonance, magnetic and non-magnetic tunnel junctions, two-dimensional conductivity in materials such as transition metals and carbon based structures (graphene, fullerenes and nanotubes). Experimental and theoretical exercises are provided, focusing on the influence of the extension on the obtained material properties. Transferable skills such as ethics, scientific terminology, scientific communication (written and verbal), making and using figures, are all an integrated part of the content. The examination is used as a learning opportunity, in which the students give a scientific talk and hand in a scientific communication on a topic or choice."

The deep connection between interactions and symmetries is pointed out. General features and shortcomings of the standard model of particle physics are reviewed. QCD is described as a working theory for the strong interaction and at the same time as a prototype for a perfect quantum field theory in the sense that it is well-defined by perturbation theory at high energies and by lattice-QCD at low energies.Properties of quarks, gluons and their composite objects, the hadrons are reviewed. Features of the strong interaction are discussed, most notably asymptotic freedom, confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Conceptual and technical aspects of perturbative and effective field theories are studied and a brief introduction to quantum field theory on a lattice is provided. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is discussed including the Higgs mechanism."

Du lär dig vilka egenskaper olika vokaler och konsonanter har gemensamt och vilka egenskaper som skiljer dem från varandra.

I prosodin ingår även svenskans ovanliga \"accenter\", alltså tonförändringar genom de långa ljuden, vilka följer strikta regler och är svåra för andraspråkstalare att komma tillrätta med.I kursens praktiska del gör du en brytningsanalys där du lyssnar på andraspråkstalares tal och analyserar det utifrån de teoretiska kunskaper kursen ger för att konstatera vad som behöver förändras i uttalet, varför, och hur man skulle kunna åstadkomma detta. Du deltar även i praktiska genomgångar och övningar i hur man kan lära ut och träna svenskt uttal i svenskundervisning på alla nivåer, från lågstadiet till vuxenundervisning.Uttalsundervisning är ett viktigt och nödvändigt inslag som bör genomsyra undervisning av svenska som andraspråk/främmande språk, och på denna kurs ges du de teoretiska och praktisk-didaktiska verktygen till detta!"

För den som håller på att lära sig svenska är det viktigt att kunna välja rätt. Och hur förklarar man sådana mönster för en person som inte kan språket än?Kursen Svensk grammatik i ett tvärspråkligt perspektiv har fokus på just regler och förklaringar till mönster i den svenska grammatiken. Kursen ägnas åt grundläggande svensk grammatik, och du får extra tillfällen att befästa kunskaperna i kursens grammatikstuga. Du kommer att få tillämpa en del nya grammatiska kunskaper i enkla analyser av elevers svenskkunskaper i text, och du kommer att få besöka och observera svenskundervisning.För den som undervisar i svenska som andraspråk är det värdefullt att ha kontrastiv kunskap om språk i världen, så du kommer även att få beskriva och analysera hur grammatiken kan se ut i många olika språk."

In sociology, a distinction is made between general theory, i.e. a theoretical interpretation of society's basic principles, and theories that are designed to analyse and interpret the tangible and empirical facts within the society's various sectors and institutions. In addition, sociological theorising also has a time diagnostic purpose, which in recent years has come to be regarded as important within the field.
